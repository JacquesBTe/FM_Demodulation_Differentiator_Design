# FM_Demodulation_Differentiator_Design
Analog FM demodulator design using a differentiator-based detector circuit with op-amp implementation, envelope detection, and active low-pass filtering. Simulated and validated in NI Multisim and lab hardware to recover an 80 Hz message from a 40 kHz carrier. 

# FM Demodulation ‚Äì Differentiator-Based Detector

## üìò Overview
This project implements a **differentiator-based FM demodulator** that converts frequency deviations of an FM signal into amplitude variations, allowing recovery of the original message signal using simple analog techniques. The system is composed of three main stages: a differentiator circuit, an envelope detector, and a low-pass filter.  

The circuit was designed, simulated, and verified in **NI Multisim**, then built and tested experimentally to validate its ability to demodulate an FM signal centered at **fc = 40 kHz** with a **message frequency of 80 Hz**.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Differentiator Circuit
- Converts frequency variations into amplitude variations (FM ‚Üí AM conversion).
- Implemented using a practical op-amp differentiator with a frequency compensation network.  
- Operates effectively between **10 kHz ‚Äì 100 kHz** to accommodate the carrier frequency range.
- Observed AM-like waveform at differentiator output, proportional to instantaneous frequency.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Envelope Detector
- Diode + RC network extracts the amplitude envelope proportional to the message signal.  
- Designed with **R = 10 kŒ©** and **C = 0.01 ŒºF** for smooth rectification.  
- Acts as the AM demodulator stage for the differentiated signal.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Low-Pass Filter (LPF)
- Second-order active low-pass filter with **3.3√ó gain** and **fc ‚âà 100 Hz**.  
- Filters out carrier and high-frequency noise, outputting the recovered baseband message.  
- Implemented with **C = 0.01 ŒºF**, **Rf = 33 kŒ©**, **Rin = 10 kŒ©**.

## üß™ Results & Observations
- **Carrier Frequency (fc):** 40 kHz  
- **Message Frequency (fm):** 80 Hz  
- **Modulation Index (Œ≤):** ~50 (for clear demodulation)  
- **Output:** Recovered sine wave around 79‚Äì81 Hz ‚Äî nearly perfect match with original message.  
- Differentiator frequency range extended up to ~363 kHz (-3dB cutoff).  
- Increasing modulation index improved clarity; small deviations caused distortion.  

**Result:** The demodulator successfully recovered the message tone with minimal distortion, verifying the differentiator-based FM demodulation principle.

## üß† Key Takeaways
- FM demodulation can be achieved using analog differentiation followed by envelope detection and filtering.
- Differentiator design range (10‚Äì100 kHz) is critical for maintaining waveform integrity.
- The envelope detector and low-pass filter stages work identically to AM demodulation once FM is converted to amplitude variation.
