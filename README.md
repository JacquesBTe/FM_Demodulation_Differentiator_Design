# FM_Demodulation_Differentiator_Design
Analog FM demodulator design using a differentiator-based detector circuit with op-amp implementation, envelope detection, and active low-pass filtering. Simulated and validated in NI Multisim and lab hardware to recover an 80 Hz message from a 40 kHz carrier.
